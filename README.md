# Block Breaker

This is a Casual 2D game **Box Shooter** made in _Unity (2018.4.36f1)_.
You control a Paddle with your mouse and your goal is to break all the blocks on the screen using the Ball provided.
The White Blocks will break on a single hit, the Yellow Blocks will break on two hits, and the Red Blocks will break on 3 hits.
Once all blocks are broken, you will proceed to next level.
If the ball falls below then the game will be over.
